# COMING SOON

This app is in rudimentary development. It is not ready, but I will post some updates soon.

The app is a terminal-based second brain app which manages notes, todos, and events. It is designed to provide a local-orientated, text-based, and suckless version of what a lot of proprietary apps like Notion already produce.

I want it to be usable on all platforms, even on iOS (using apps like iSH or a-Shell)
