# ORG

## What is Org?

Welcome to Org. Org is a note, todo, and event management software for the terminal.

It is designed to be simple, and to provide a 'suckless', open-source, and locally-based version of what existing proprietary software (like 'Notion') provides.

It is not a replacement for the rich feature-set of Notion, but rather a non-proprietary alternative to the most basic features of a 'second-brain' application: organisation of notes, todos, and events, with the ability to view and query key aspects of your workspace in different ways.

The following principles are key to the philosophy of Org:
    - **Local Storage**: Your data should be owned by you and controlled by you, and should primarily be stored locally on user-owned machines (or, if beyond, entirely at the user's discretion)
    - **Accessible Formats**: Data should be stored in an efficient format which works for humans but also can be manipulated by computers (i.e. the likes of simple .txt and/or .md files)
    - **Simple Querying**: Your data should be easily traversable by humans and machines, with simple and efficient mechanisms for important and required data to be front-and-centre without much or any effort (i.e. simple querying mechanisms)
    - **Simple Structure**: This is linked to the previous point. A simple structure enables easy querying of the data, but it should also maintain simplicity so that *you* should be able to use and navigate your data without any additional software (including Org). The structure of your data should also be compatible with both *NO* and *OTHER* software (i.e. your data should be free from constraints and portable)

## Installation

`yay -S org`

### Compatibility

At this early stage of development, I have only tested Org on Linux, though it should work on Mac0S. I haven't tested it on Windows.

## Setup

1. Create an empty folder. This will be the home of all your files (notes, todos, and events).

    *Note: [Make a note for those who may have notes in the Org format already]*
    TODO: Consider migration of data in a future version of Org

2. Run `org init` in the folder. This will initialise your folder with Org, and create the `/note` `/todo` and `/event` subdirectories.
3. TODO: Add information here about device setup

## How to use Org

Org has two main functionalities, both of which can be used on the command line: `view` and `create`.

### `org create`: creating files

`org create` is the simplest way to create note, todo, or event files in your workspace. It is generally safer than creating the file manually, as `org create` will take care of file format for you (though you can still create files manually. Org will check and validate every file in your workspace).

All Org files are markdown text files (.md) with YAML front-matter for metadata. Each file-type (note, todo, or event) has its own YAML format.

`org create note`: This will create an empty note markdown file with the following YAML front matter:

```YAML
---
item: Note
title: yyyymmdd-hhmmss
category: workspace_name
tags: default_tag
created:
modified:
uid:
---
```

### `org view`: viewing and querying files
