`NOTE: This is the alpha release. This will probably break for you, and it will be slower than the ideal. Only the most basic features exist (see the command list), and I am still writing some of the core commands. I am a while off from a beta release, which would be the first release that would be usable by a wider audience. This release is to test the simplest of functionality, and nothing more. Feedback on such matters is welcome.`

## What is `org`?

`Org` aims to be a text-first,  suckless, second-brain CLI tool.

`Org` is a terminal-based tool designed for managing notes, todos, and events. It is seeking to meet the need for a 'second-brain' which many have in our modern age; the need to capture, organise, and query an overflow of personal information and data in order to maximise its usefulness.

Why not just use Notion, Evernote, or even Apple Notes/Reminders? Most - if not all - 'second-brain' apps today force users to cede territory in key areas, such as: locality of data storage, accessibility and portability of data, simplicity of data, and, most notably: the cost of organising data.

`Org` wants to meet the same needs these apps meet while honouring these following core principles:

- **Locality** — Your data should stay on your machines or wherever you choose.
- **Accessibility** — Your data should remain in accessible and portable formats - such as plain-text files.
- **Simplicity** — Your data should be organised and structured simply so that it is compatible with other (or no) software and querying tools.
- **Affordability** - All the above should be available to you for free.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

The only package manager which hosts `org` currently is `yay`. Install with: `yay -S org`.

For those who don't use `yay`: I plan to make `org` available on as many platforms as I can. For now, the below instructions will suffice while I am alpha testing:

```bash
pip install "git+https://github.com/benjaminingreens/org.git@v0.1.4"
```

If you have a managed environment, do something like this:

```bash
# 1. Create a dedicated virtual environment for org
python3 -m venv ~/.venvs/org

# 2. Install org into that environment
~/.venvs/org/bin/pip install "git+https://github.com/benjaminingreens/org.git@v0.1.6"

# 3. Create a bin directory in your home if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin

# 4. Create a wrapper script so you can run 'org' without activating the venv
echo '~/.venvs/org/bin/org "$@"' > ~/.local/bin/org
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/org

# 5. Add ~/.local/bin to your PATH if it's not already there
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.profile
. ~/.profile
```

To update, run:
```bash
~/.venvs/org/bin/pip install -U "git+https://github.com/benjaminingreens/org.git@v0.1.6"
```

### 2. Initialise

Run `org init` **in the directory you want to use as your org workspace**.

From then on, running `org` inside any subfolder will operate at the workspace directory automatically.

## Using Your Workspace

At this early stage, `org` manages three types of files:

`.txt` files - or 'notes'  
`.td` files - or 'todos'  
`.ev` files - or 'events'  

### 1. `Note` Conventions

`Org` relies on YAML-style metadata in `.txt` files to index and manage your notes. For example:

```YAML
---
title: Note title
tags: [general]
---

this is the note content
```

Officially, no metadata is required when the user creates a `.txt` note. However, if no metadata is input by the user, `Org` will assume the following defaults:

```YAML
---
title: YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS
tags: [general]
authour: <your_name>
creation: YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS
---

this is the note content
```

If the user wishes, they may include a `description` property to include a brief description of their note. `Org` does not assume any defaults for this property.

### 2. `Todo` and `Event` Conventions

`.td` (todo) and `.ev` (event) files follow similar conventions to one another.

Todos and events are stored in respective files; todos can only be stored in `.td` files, and events can only be stored in `.ev` files. They cannot be stored together.

Here is an example of a `.td` file:
```td
* t: buy drinks for sam's party
```

Here is an example of an `.ev` file:
```ev
* e: sam's party
```

Both can be stored with metadata, like so:

```td
* t: buy drinks for sam's party // #shopping
```

```ev
* e: sam's party // #birthdays
```

The `//` separates the actual todo/event from its metadata.

As you might have guessed, the `#` symbol represents a `tag`, and is the in-line equivalent to the `tags` property in the `.txt` notes file.

Below is a table showing the metadata schemas for todo and event files:

`r` = required
`d` = defaultable (org will generate a default value without user input)
`n` = not required / optional (org will not generate a default value without user input)
`a` = automatic (org will generate a value regardless of user input)  
`-` = n/a (property not compatible)

| name        | syntax  | todo | event | multiple | type     | format          |
|-------------|---------|------|-------|----------|----------|-----------------|
| tag         | `#foo`  | d    | d     | true     | list     | array           |
| authour     | `$foo`  | d    | d     | false    | str      | string          |
| creation    | `~foo`  | a    | a     | false    | datetime | YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS |
| status      | `=foo`  | d    | d     | false    | str      | string          |
| assignee    | `@foo`  | d    | d     | true     | list     | array           |
| priority    | `!foo`  | d    | d     | false    | int      | integer         |
| title       | `/foo`  | –    | –     | false    | str      | string          |
| description | `+foo`  | –    | –     | false    | str      | string          |
| deadline    | `%foo`  | n    | –     | false    | datetime | YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS |
| start       | `>foo`  | –    | r     | false    | datetime | YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS |
| pattern     | `^foo`  | –    | n     | false    | str      | string          |
| end         | `<foo`  | –    | n     | false    | datetime | YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS |

## Command List

`Note`: These commands are largely in development. The most mature part of `org` so far is the indexing and validation logic (that is, structure and storage of data). Useful methods for querying data is the next key stage of development for `org`. So far, most of these commands are glorified placeholders. Every single command you see here is about 20% complete, and will have much more added to it in future.

Before running through other commands, it is worth mentioning the `org collab` command. This command enables you to set up a connection between two distinct workspaces so that many of the below commands apply to multiple workspaces at once (except for `org tidy` and `org group` - which only apply to the current workspace). `org collab` will ask you to define a 'ceiling' - a reference point from which org will search for other workspaces, which will usually be your `/home`. It will then ask you to enter a workspace id to connect to a workspace. This id can be found in the `.orgroot` file of any workspace.

| command                          | description                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `org init`                       | Initialises a directory as an org workspace                                 |
| `org notes`                      | Lists all notes managed by org                                              |
| `org todos`                      | Lists all priority 1 & 2 todo items in the workspace                        |
| `org events`                     | Lists all events of the day                                                 |
| `org report`                     | Combination of `org todos` and `org events` (custom reports in future)      |
| `org tags`                       | Lists all tags found in the workspace                                       |
| `org tidy`                       | Organises files into `YYYY/MM` folders by modification time or project dirs (see below)|
| `org group <project_name> [tag1] ...` | Creates `_project_name` dir with links to relevant tags, enabling `org tidy` to move notes, todos, and events with relevant tags into this dir|
| `org add`                       | COMING SOON: Create new notes/todos/events                                       |
| `org archive`                       | COMING SOON: Move items to archive |

Notes:
1. Sorting and filtering to be included for `org notes`, `org todos`, and `org events`, in the future    
2. Custom reports to be included for `org report` in future
3. There are some hidden commands for fun. Many of which are still in development
4. You will have noticed that all files are stored either in `YYYY/MM` directories, or in project directories. A part of the philosophy of `org` is to abstract as much structure as possible from the filesystem, and keep it as atomic (file-inherent) as possible. This is part of the 'second-brain' mechanism which aims to reduce mental load. 'Zettelkasten' philosophy is an inspiration in this regard
